Deploy Static Website on AWS

In this project, I deployed a static website to AWS using S3, CloudFront, and IAM.

The files included are: 

index.html - The Index document for the website.
/img - The background image file for the website.
/vendor - Bootssrap CSS framework, Font, and JavaScript libraries needed for the website to function.
/css - CSS files for the website.

###### Note For Reviewer#############


Dear Reviewer,

Thank you, for the guidelines.

I have made the modifications you instructed. 
Yes, you are correct when you assumed that I had deleted the bucket.
 I did that with the intention of managing my free subscription quota.

Therefore, to meet with the current requirements I had to recreate the entire bucket all over again.
Therefore in my "The website is distributed via Cloudfront.png" file you will see two cloudfront \
distribution there: the one enabled is for the new bucket, while the other disabled is for the old bucket.

 Thanks.
